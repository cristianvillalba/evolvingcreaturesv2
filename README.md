Evolving Creatures - revisited

I tried to implement the paper from Karl Sim's Evolved Virtual Creatures with some adjustments.
More information here:
https://www.karlsims.com/evolved-virtual-creatures.html

It uses Java, JmonkeyEngine, Bullet Physics and a tiny neural network to control motion.

The purpose is to evolve a virtual worm creature to follow a target

Now I simplified the code a lot.

Hope some day the "worms" starts thinking.
Maybe they will take over the world.

Sorry...
